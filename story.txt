Once upon a time in the 1890s, there was a hunter called Zoid who was drafted as one of the 12 people in a game called HUNT. The purpose of this game was to defeat the bounty that was at one of the places at the Stillwater Bayou and leave with the bounty alive and not let the other 11 hunters capture the bounty. The Stillwater Bayou was a 1km by 1km area swamp that contained zombies, wolves, alligators, and other wild creatures. To help him with his hunt, Zoid decided to bring the Mosin Nagant rifle and Mauser C96. Zoid was very famous for his good aim with these two guns.
